title: Editorial planning with Trello and Zapier
subTitle: >-
  As long as I've been working with editorial teams a content pipeline has been
  a problem. Knowing the state of a story, its context to those around it, and
  who has done what, when, is vital in managing a content throughput. Generally,
  this Ô¨Ågures itself out in a busy, noisy, physical environment. But, the more
  remote a team becomes, the more challenging it is to communicate on the state
  of stories.

When I joined [EMBL](www.embl.org) a couple of months ago, this was a problem we had. Content status was done weekly, but a continually available overview by the entire team was not. Nor was there a tool or process to push stories around. As I said, my experience is this is not unique to EMBL. Almost every editorial team I've worked with struggles with this.	

[Dan](https://twitter.com/thenoyes) and I got our heads together and worked on a process that would fit with the existing team and tools. The team here use Trello extensively for planning, so we started there.
## The one board to rule them all
It was important we didn't interfere with existing processes using Trello. The team all use Trello in different, interesting ways to collaborate and manage their content; from ideas to final copy. We needed to integrate with that best we could. This is what we settled on:
### 1. A Pre-production Trello Board

Once a story is ready to go into the workflow. Meaning it is agreed, planned, assigned to a priority etc, then it is added to the pre-production Trello board. This board is organised by story type: features, updates, press releases. Once a story is complete and ready to publish, it is moved into a column 'Move to Production'.[Zapier](www.Zapier.com)  then copies the card, with everything in it, over to the Production board. Once that's done, it moves it to an archive list.
    
  1.  Find the Pre-production Trello board
  2.  Find a list on that board called 'Move to Production'
  3.  Find cards moved into that list (this is the trigger to run the whole zap)
  4.  Get information about the card and move it to Production. (In fact, here, I didn't move it but copied it. I wanted a safe-guard in the system so that if something went wrong, there would be a backup)
  5.  Once it's moved, confirm by then moving the card into the archive list.
  6.  Once all that's done, check the card has actually moved.
  7.  Then post to Slack and let everyone know.
